How to run the server - Fork and clone this repo - cd into express-server-side and run npm install or npm i - This should install dependencies like nodemon - Add a .env file that includes the CONNECTION_STRING you can get from Heroku, the SESSION_SECRET which is simply a random string of characters, and SERVER_PORT where you will be running the server on (for this project I had decided this to be 3333) - In the root of the express-server-side, run nodemon - If doesn't run, you may need to npm install nodemon
